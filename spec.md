# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the standalone name display on line 2 of the hero/tidbit intro block from "Dr. Shane J Charbonnet" (or any variant) to "Dr. Shane JC".

**Planned changes:**
- Change the second line of the tidbit/intro block to read exactly "Dr. Shane JC"

**User-visible outcome:** The tidbit/intro block shows "Dr. Shane JC" as the standalone name on line 2, while all other text in that block remains unchanged.
