  "summary": "REQ-12 appears implemented by forcing `next-themes` to `light` across all App render branches (normal, loading, payment success/failure), and by ensuring the body uses `bg-background`. REQ-13 is only partially evidenced: the Header brand pill/button background was changed to a light surface, but there is no direct diff evidence that the Hero intro text container background was updated to a light/white fill. The diff summary also indicates multiple unrequested content/layout changes beyond the stated non-goals.",
  "missing_requirements": [

      "id": "REQ-13",
      "requirement": "Update any explicitly dark UI surfaces that conflict with the new white background so text remains highly readable, including the Header brand pill/button background and the Hero intro text container background.",
      "reason": "The Header brand area change is evidenced, but the diff does not show `Hero.tsx` changes confirming the neon green bordered intro text container has a light/white (or very light) fill for readability; the file diff provided does not include Hero code.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/Header.tsx (shows brand button uses `bg-card` instead of a dark/black surface)",
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (mentions Hero intro text block exists, but does not evidence its background/fill classes)",
