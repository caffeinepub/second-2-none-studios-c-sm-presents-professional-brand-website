      "reason": "No new static asset file was added (\"Added: 0\"), and no evidence is shown of referencing an uploaded audio filename under /assets/ in code. Without an added audio file, the requirement to use the uploaded original audio asset cannot be met.",

      "reason": "The Hero.tsx content is truncated before the portrait/headings area where the player would be inserted, and the excerpt provided contains no visible <audio> element or player implementation. Therefore, the required placement and presence of standard audio controls cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary.",
