The provided diff excerpt for `Hero.tsx` is truncated before the relevant intro paragraph content, so the requested change cannot be verified from the evidence shown. Two additional files were modified that are not part of the request.",

      "reason": "The `Hero.tsx` diff is truncated and does not include the intro paragraph text/content region, so there is no visible evidence that the leading whitespace was removed (or that styling/spacing remained unchanged).",
