The diff also includes additional unrelated Hero/UI/content changes and project tracking metadata updates that were not requested.",

      "requirement": "If the static asset file exists in the repo, delete the corresponding static image file `/assets/generated/layered-background.dim_1920x1080.jpg` from frontend static assets so it no longer consumes project storage.",
