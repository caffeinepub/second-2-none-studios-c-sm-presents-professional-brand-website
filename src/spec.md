# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a “Site Soundtrack” label directly above the existing YouTube Music access hyperlinks.

**Planned changes:**
- Insert a single-line text label immediately above the YouTube Music links with the exact text: "Site Soundtrack."
- Style the label with a medium-sized font and a rich, brilliant neon lime green text color.

**User-visible outcome:** Users see a neon lime “Site Soundtrack” label directly above the YouTube Music access links, with the links continuing to work as before.
