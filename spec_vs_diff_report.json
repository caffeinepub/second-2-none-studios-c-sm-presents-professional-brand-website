  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to backend/main.mo, frontend-file-summaries.txt, frontend/SMOKE_TEST_CHECKLIST.md, and project_state.json. The smoke test checklist references the production URL https://drsjc-studios-gdr.caffeine.xyz/ and the project_state.json records REQ-1 as pending. However, the build request explicitly states its non-goal is making code or content changes — the sole requirement is publishing/promoting the draft to production. The diff contains code changes which appear to be content/code changes rather than a pure publish action. There is no evidence of a deployment promotion action that would promote the draft to production. The project_state.json still marks the feature as 'pending', suggesting the publish has not been completed.",
